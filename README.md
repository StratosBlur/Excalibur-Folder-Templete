#  React + Redux Folder Structure Templete 🤣
My favorite folder structure With the addition of Duck structure. But it's okay if you don't like it Or if you can recommend it, it will be very good by opening all pull requests.

## Include ✌
- react-redux
- redux-thunk
- react-router
- how to do with this project.

## How to use 👍
clone this project Then create work. At first time you must install dependencie by `yarn` or `npm install` (yarn recommend 🐱)
- development command: `yarn start ` or `npm start`
- test command: `yarn test` or `npm run test`
- get bunddle and asset: `yarn build` or `npm run build`

## Note
You must change name in package.json and Hopefully there will be more or less benefits for you. Thank you 💕😘
